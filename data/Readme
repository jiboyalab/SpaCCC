We provide readers with 4 sets of data as detailed in the following data descriptions. Note that in order to reduce the computational overhead and to make it easier for readers to reproduce our code, we will use the smaller test data in the following tutorials. Processing of other single-cell RNA-Seq data follows the same core pipeline as the test data. Due to the large size of the data, we uploaded them to the Google Drive.
